This is an interactive real estate website created by me to enchancing my frontend skills (responsive) and backend skills (firebase authentication). 
In this website user could search the properties in a prefered location with labeled prices and required accessories.
I also include a interactive contact page where the user could send the contact request via email using webforms.
I also use framer motion for animations.
